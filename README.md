## Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
 A Crop Recommendation System (CRS) is a technological solution designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to cultivate based on various factors such as soil characteristics, climate conditions, and historical crop performance. The primary goal of such a system is to enhance agricultural productivity, optimize resource usage, and contribute to sustainable farming practices. Crop Recommendation System leverages data-driven insights and machine learning algorithms to provide farmers with tailored recommendations for crop selection, contributing to sustainable and efficient agricultural practices.

## About
Agriculture and its allied sectors are undoubtedly the largest providers of livelihoodism rural India. The agriculture sector is also a significant contributor factor to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Blessing to the country is the overwhelming size of the agricultural sector. However, regrettable is the yield per hectare of crops in comparison to international standards. This is one of the possible causes for a higher suicide rate among marginal farmers in India. This paper proposes a viable and user- friendly yield prediction system for the farmers. The proposed system provides connectivity to farmers via a mobile application. GPS helps to identify the user location. The user provides the area & soil type as input. Machine learning algorithms allow choosing the most profitable crop list or predicting the crop yield for a user-selected crop. To predict the crop yield, selected Machine Leaming algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Multivariate Linear
 
Regression (MLR), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) are used. Among them, the Random Forest showed the best results with 95% accuracy. Additionally, the system also suggests the best time to use the fertilizers to boost up the yield.

## Results and Impact
We have proposed this with more efficiency and definitely it will be useful for the farmers. By this system, the can decision a profitable crop and then he gain more profit from that crop. By this the economy of the country will increase. Our work would help farmers to increase productivity in agriculture, prevent soil degradation in cultivated land, and reduce chemical use in crop production and efficient use of water resources.
